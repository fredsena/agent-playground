# Agent Playground

A comprehensive collection of AI agent experiments, implementations, and patterns using modern agentic frameworks.

This repository serves as a playground for exploring various agentic architectures, from simple tool-calling chains to complex multi-agent state machines.

## 🚀 Key Features & Experiments

- **LangGraph State Machines**: Implementation of structured agentic flows like customer support and pizza ordering systems.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Knowledge routers and planners that coordinate between specialized agents.
- **Advanced Summarization**: Deep agent-based file summarizers leveraging both monolithic and modular approaches.
- **Middleware & Interceptors**: Custom LangChain v1 middleware for observability and control.
- **MCP Integration**: Experimental support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.12+
- **Orchestration**: LangChain, LangGraph
- **Models**: OpenAI (and other providers via LangChain)
- **Utilities**: `tavily-python` (search), `beautifulsoup4` (scraping), `rich` (terminal UI)

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `01-08.*.py`: Sequential experiments demonstrating evolving agent complexity.
- `utils/`: shared helper functions and core agent logic.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and resources.
- `resources/`: Assets and data used by the agents.
